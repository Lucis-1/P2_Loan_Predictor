A women's clothing boutique is being sold close to where we live.  This is a great location as it is across the street from a middle school and sandwiched between a brand new neighborhood and a developing neighborhood.  It is being sold because the seller has 2 other businesses and is unable to grow & manage this boutique to achieve profitability quicker.  Though there will be seller financing, a down payment is expected and we will need some extra money to act as a buffer for intangibles.  The Good: We tend to quickly increase profitability by lowering some of the overhead costs.  We intend to sell retail as well as act as a broker for those looking to make high end specialty purchases.  We will develop the website so that it will serve as a social networking site that will allow us to take input from shoppers who are looking for unique fashions.  Items will be sold on the site, and overstock items will be directed to overseas markets.  We intend to keep inventories fairly low.  My income is sufficient to cover extra problems that may arise.  My wife is not working and will manage & grow the business full time.  The Bad: This is retail and it may not be profitable for at least 6 months (thats not your problem though....).  The customer base is undeveloped and we will need to do a significant amount of marketing to build it.  This should not be too big a problem though as my wife is a recent MBA grad.  The Ugly: I'm in grad school and my loans will come calling by the end of summer in 08.  Since my last personal loan I have not defaulted or been late with any payments, but I have gotten more credit cards and have increased my available balances on all of them very recently; this may be a why it has gone down.

Our income did not match it after it got beyond us and we ended up in debt.  We went to Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University and ended up even leading a class helping others to get out of debt and live debt-free as we are in the middle of doing.    We have had NO credit cards (we stopped using them long ago and then cut them up).  We work two jobs each bringing in now around $90K a year.  We live on a budget and cash envelope system.  We make timely payments always on our things (as my credit report will show).  Our credit rating is 720 even after all this. We have added $0 to our debt in the same time period as well!  Though our debt is larger than that we have been paying on, with this loan we would pay off at least one high-interest credit card (we already cut up long ago) and much of a smaller Home Equity loan.  This would bring our number of loans to pay off debt down to two eventually, have a lower interest rate over all, and lower monthly payment - also it would enable us to possibly be in a position to pay off more rapidly the remaining balance on the Home Equity loan.    We have lived on budget, faith, hard work for a year and we are going to kill the debt as we remain on this path.  Our older daughters are also on their own cash envelope system and do not have credit cards, using the Dave Ramsey system as well - they work jobs and pay for much of their own things so we all add no debt.  Our other child is under 13.  We are in good health, pay for good medical insurance, and life insurance and live healthy (no smokers and no alcohol and no gambling or other vices).    Thank you for considering our family for this loan.   It will be  a huge part of paying off the high-interest loans and reduce the overall interest and payments to eventually being debt free.",debt_consolidation,Consolidate and Elinate Debt Forever,775xx,TX,17.11,0,0,0,0,6,0,54925,97.8,27,f,4183.94,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,122th week,0,,,,1

I have 3 different credit cards all due at different times not to mention a car payment, rent, utilities, etc.  I have asked all the credit card companies for higher limits so I could consolidate to make one payment, but again, 2-3 years ago, when I was working 20 hours a week at a grocery store and going to school full time I had late payments and overdraft charges (mostly due to the late payment fees).

LendingClub is telling me to put my loan request in """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""context"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" for you so here goes...  Ultimately the loan will serve several purposes, but will primarily be used as a debt consolidation tool.   I studied abroad in Oxford for about six months, and although I had the time of my life, and wouldn't give it back for the world, I think you'd have to live on the other side of the moon to not know how depressingly weak the U.S. dollar is, especially against the pound! Needless to say the fun didn't come cheap. Therefore a majority of the loan will be used to consolidate debt not only from my time in Oxford but at the University of San Diego as well.  The remaining balance will be used to help reignite an eBay business I never should have put on pause. Throughout all of high school and the first year of college (as well as a little bit this summer, before entering hell ah I mean the working world) I operated a surprisingly successful business effectively arbitraging products between eBay's U.S. and United Kingdom websites. Confused? Here's an example: this summer I purchased as many iPhones as I could afford at full retail price. The kicker is that I didn't turn around and sell them on eBay.com, but on eBay.co.uk - in Pounds Sterling, effectively making 2 to 1 on every phone sold. Though arbitrage has a dirty sound to it, it is nothing of the sort. The only problem has been that I haven't had enough of a cash position to buy product in bulk, and therefore reduce my cost of goods sold and ultimately increase profits. If I can obtain the requested loan amount I don't see that being a problem anymore. Finally, and perhaps most importantly to you, there is very little risk in such a business model - unless you believe in the mighty dollar’s ability to bounce back sometime soon, but for those of you who read… well I won’t digress.   Background Information:  I am originally from the great state of Minnesota but I moved to SoCal to attend the University of San Diego, from where I graduated last spring with degrees in Accounting and History. I am currently working for Deloitte & Touche as an auditor at Sempra Energy (a Fortune 500 company) in San Diego. I have no student loans (my education was my inheritance) or car loans or loans of any sort. Simply put, payments will not be a problem.   Thank you so much for your time, I truly appreciate it!

Lending and credit services are provided to individuals who do not have cash resources or access to credit to meet short term cash needs.The pawn shop will also provide services to people who are unable (or unwilling) to do business with commercial banks. Pawn shop will offer non-recourse loans collateralized by tangible personal property such as jewelry, consumer electronics, tools, sporting goods, musical instruments, etc.   An average loan is small, usually  $75-$100 at an interest rate of 15% per month (180 % APR) The pawn shop will hold the merchandise for  60-90 days, giving the borrower time to repay the loan amount plus interest. Statistically, 15-20% of pawn shops customers do not repay the loan, which allows the pawn shop to generate additional profit (In Addition To The Interest Charges) from the items resale. Since the loan amount is based on 30% of the items market value, defaulted loans can be one of the shops biggest profit generators. A typical loan at a pawn shop is for $75.00 and is secured by a household item worth $200.00. If the loan is not repaid within 30 days the pawn shop gets to keep the item. With the on line auction site E-Bay, disposition of unclaimed loan merchandise is quite easy and profitable.  Additional revenue soures for the ship are: Check cashing for people to cash checks who do not have a bank. Purchasing gold and jewelry outright from people (gold is trading at an all time high, which has a lot of people selling their old rings and jewelry).

Subsequent to his receiving a student visa and enrolling in courses this fall, I will cosign his private student loan applications to support the remainder of his education.  I have offered my financial support because my brother-in-law has demonstrated to me that he has the aptitude and interest for a successful career in engineering. I have spoken with him at length about my experience with the academic rigor involved in engineering coursework.

For the first time in my life, I was unemployed in 2001 (last recession) for 8 months and used credit cards to pay expenses.  I chose not to file bankruptcy as I felt responsible to pay my debts. A few collection accounts (paid) from 2001 adversely affected my credit score for the past 7 years which meant the credit card APR's were high and paying down the debt was difficult.  Despite making more than the minimum payments;  making steady payments; and having a stable job (professional) and residency, my credit card/loan accounts are with the now notable BIG three banks.  In January of 2008, one of the banks raised my APR without providing a reason in writing!  I received a letter, but it only stated my APR would increase.  First I was told it was because of an adverse credit report and when I checked into this, it was not accurate.  Over the course of a year, when I requested to have the rate returned to the previous APR or reduced, the request was refused.  BUT, they were more than willing to offer me a """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""great deal"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" where they would give me another credit card at a low interest rate!!  I refused and when I did the research, I discovered that this was a new tactic being used where the higher interest credit card account would have been closed and opening another account would have adversely affected my credit score (thus further indebting me to that bank)!!!!  This offer occurred when my credit score improved as the collections accounts from 2001 were no longer on my credit report......It is important to note that one of my bank card holders raised my credit limit at a time when banks were lowering credit limits and the bank that raised my APR, never lowered my credit limit......I'm not a high risk, I'm a cash cow and enslaved to the BIG Banks!!

These expenses ranged from a once-a-week coffee to 500-page textbooks.  Since I was an out-of-state student, I could not use the same state-paid scholarship I would have been entitled to had I attended an in-state university. However, I felt the added benefit of the out-of-state university outweighed the marginal benefit of staying in-state. I picked up jobs to pay for my rent and tuition.  Now that I am finished, I am looking to consolidate my debt from my two high-interest credit cards charging around ~27% APR. This rate was locked in when I first started using a credit card and had no prior history.  Even with a high interest rate, I am consistent in paying more than 3 times the minimum required payment.  I believe I am a responsible borrower. I have been living in the same apartment for 3 years now, do not spend frivolously, and pay three times the minimum payment each month.

I am going to exercise my option to buy, which is $21,400.  The car is in excellent condition, I have only put 16,000 miles on it.  Comparable 2006 Infiniti G35s at a dealership cost $24,000 - $26,500.    I plan to pay the Connecticut car taxes and fees in cash, put down approximately $4,000 of the price, and would like to finance the remainder.  I could put down substantially more in cash if I desired, however, I am saving for an engagement ring for my girlfriend, and the subsequent wedding of course.  Thus, paying off the $17,500 over three years will allow for a relatively small car payment and free up ample cash to have the ring by Fall, and then save for the wedding in Summer of 2011.  Financially, I am in very sound shape.  I am an attorney, currently working as an international tax and global restructuring senior associate at PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP.  The firm, unlike its Big 4 counterparts, has announced it intends to weather the financial crisis without laying off employees.  Irrespective of this, I work in an area of tax law that is doing robust business due to pending proposed legislation involving multinational corporations.    I have been with PwC for over three years, and have consistently received the highest possible ratings during our year end review process.  I currently make $117,500 a year before bonuses.  My monthly take-home income, after 401(k) contributions, is approximately $7,000.     My main monthly expense is the approximately $2,600 I pay in home ownership cost (inclusive of insurance, condo fee, and utilities).  Otherwise I pay $350 in monthly student loans, and then for the basics (cable, cell phone, car insurance, gas, etc).  I have zero credit card debt.  My current lease payment is $516 a month, so the montly payment on the loan I am seeking would be more than this, but not substantially more.  That pretty much covers it.  I have a very secure job that pays well, and the reason I am looking to finance the purchase is so I can save for a ring and wedding over the next two years, while still having ample cash on hand to live life.

At the end of 2008, Bank of America cut our credit. This left us with a double-whammy. First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field. A $9 billion project is about to be completed, and for our clients this means thousands of units to be sold and leased. In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""long term"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us. And that is why I am here, so that our company will continue to realize the success which it has had for 25 years.    Please feel free to ask any questions. I will gladly provide any additional details you may require.

All of this is good news for us -- as long as we have capital to take advantage of our growth opportunities. This is the main reason for contacting Lending Club, and seeking this short-term loan.<br/>  > I was recently notified by my Credit Keeper account that as of May 18, 2010, my FICO score is at 750. I thought that members of the Lending Club, who may be interested in investing in this current loan, would like to know that.

I am a recent college graduate (class of '08) in Massachusetts who is employed by a private school's technology department.  My current gross annual income is 35,000 and I am receiving a promotion which will come into effect in early July.  While the new salary has not yet been negotiated, it will be a substantial increase (in excess of 10%).  I own a fully paid off car and rent a very inexpensive apartment (I have roommates, and pay a total of $400 a month after all utilities).    If you have already looked at my credit report, you will see that there are some small revolving balances as well as large installment ones.  The large installment balances are loans related to my education.  They are co-signed by my father, and he is the one who has been making the scheduled payments to them.  His financial situation is very secure and I see no reason he will not repay those ahead of schedule.    My request today, however, involves the revolving debt.  You will notice three accounts of interest, a Citi card account, a Capital One card account, and a Dell Financial Services account.  The three accounts charge 19%, 0%, and 0% respectively.  The Capital one account, while charging 0% currently, will soon increase its rate.  I expect to have the Dell account paid off well before the scheduled rate increase (in January).    As such, I've come to Lending Club seeking $6,000 to fully pay off my Citi and Capital one accounts.  Both credit cards were opened in my time between graduation and employment, an unfortunate but necessary way to raise funds.  My plan is to (pending loan approval) pay off the cards and then cease using them except for emergencies. My new income should be quite sufficient to live on and pay the Lending Club loan well before three years.    When selecting Lending Club two things attracted me.  One, of course, is the fantastic rates.  The other, however, is that I find the idea of small scale lenders (such as yourselves) making interest on my loans much preferable to the big banks to whom I am currently indebted.    Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to providing any additional information or clarification.

The first business line is a residential/commercial tree, landscaping and lawn service.  The second line of business, sells the raw materials acquired by the first line; namely wood fuel, mulch, firewood and also accepts green waste from individual consumers as well as cities and municipalities.   You can visit our website at Braikbrothers.com to learn more about our company. We have been growing rapidly but, have found it difficult to access working capital by conventional measures so, decided to give this a try.   I have worked in financial services for the past 13 years.  I own a significant amount of residential and rural real estate with an average LTV of approximately 60%.  My largest real estate holding is 365acres in rural central MO.  The property is appraised at roughly $1.1MM (w/a $650k mortgage).  Most local lenders are not willing to increase the LTV on this loan with cash out above 65%.  My brother was the Controller/CFO of a family owned tree service in St. Louis for 6 years.  During this time he gained an enormous amount of practical, hands on experience into how a successful tree service should be run.  We have two certified arborists on staff.  One of which is eligible to sit for the Master Arborist certification which requires being a certified arborist for at least 6 years.  We have grown from 3 full-time employees when we officially began offering services in September of last year and given the demand for our services in Columbia and St. Louis, MO, currently employ 10 full-time employees.  With my brother heading up the day-to-day operations, a professional and well-trained staff to complete the work and my ability to provide personal capital and access to further financing I am very bullish on the prospects for our business.    As with any new business access to working capital is a key ingredient to success and I am excited by the opportunities this site may provide.  I can be contacted via email (jsbraik@yahoo.com) at any time should you require additional information.

I currently am on a credit guard program that when I first began the fee was reasonable but now that I am down to my last credit card to pay off I am paying them interest thats higher than the interest on the card itself. That credit cards balance is about $2000. I also have a credit loan out on my checking account of about $500 for overdraft protection fees. The last person i need to pay off is my dad of $2000. Over some time with my very used Jeep he has been charging it's reapairs to his credit cards and I am having a difficult time paying him on time and I am falling behind in payments.

I have talked to B of A numerous times to try to lower that interest rate because of course they pay off the lower interest rates first so the higher interest rate part keeps climbing.

Though we live away from Indiana, we have our own team set up locally in Indianapolis, consisting of a general contractor, a construction mgmt company, a realtor, a home inspector, and a property management company.  We coordinated all aspects of the renovation of the first rental property from right here WA.  The renovation was a big success and ended before the scheduled end date, thanks to the very talented team.  Upon securing our second rental property, we will be using the same team to renovate it, lease it out, and collect rents.  Monthly rents from the 2nd rental property will be covering our monthly payments to you (Lendingclub lenders).  It would take a month or two before the property becomes move-in ready and gets rented out.  This will most likely result in a situation where we have to pay you before we collect any rent from our tenant.  So, what do we do if we have to pay you before collecting the first rent???  How do we make sure we meet our Lendingclub obligation???  No problem at all.  We own our existing rental house, free and clear.  Because of that, net cash flow from it is more than enough to cover our monthly Lendingclub payment, in case we have to use that source.  As many families lost their precious homes to foreclosure, they are desperately searching for a house to rent.  This has increased the demand for rental houses.  We would like to help a family get a house.  To summarize, you as a Lendingclub lender have a very low risk and have a return that's unbelievably higher than that of banks.

My pension plan does not allow more than one loan at a time. I need approximately $18,000 to pay off my current loan. I would like to borrow $18,000 from Lending Club to pay off my current pension plan loan. I will then re-apply for another loan with my pension plan to take advantage of my higher pension plan balance. I will then pay Lending Club back as soon as my old Pension Plan loan is paid off and the new loan is issued.   My employer and I renegotiated my contract for five years adding about $1,000 a month to my income. I now make $128,000 per year. In January 2010 I will be making and addtional $2,500 per year. I  have a clause in my contract that if I am fired, I will be paid three months pay as well as my sick time and vacation time. I have been working here for nearly three years. Due to a signed contract I will be another five years.  It is my intention to repay the loan I borrow from Lending Club within 30 days. This pension plan at my current workplace has a balance of nearly $60,000 and the plan allows for up to 50% loan. In addition I have another $10,000 in my 457(b) (Deferred Comp Plan) which I will tap into to assist me in paying as much of my credit card debt as I can.   I will secure the loan I get from you against the balance in my 401(a) Pension Plan until it is paid in full (again, I believe it should be less than one month).  My overall intention is to pay off about $15,000 in credit card debt. At that point I will only have $4,000 left which I will pay for in six months. I will then be paying off the pension plan loan.  (Chase $5,550.00, Discover $5,250.00 and Chase #2 $4,750.00)  Due to the short term nature of the loan, I am willing to pay up to a 1.5% fee plus an interest rate of up to 10%. My calculations are that Lending Club will make about $420 for a loan of $18,000 for thirty days.  This is a long story but I am trying to pay off all my debt (including my mortgage) in the next 84 months. This will greatly assist me in doing that.

We have spent her federal loans already, and need some money to pay for the final 3 semesters of school.  She is just shy of a 4.0 at the New England Institute of Art and is the top student in her major.  She has been working internships at Oxymorons (an independent film to be released in 2010, for which she started as a production assistant and was promoted twice, first to script supervisor and then to first assistant director), at WGBH in Boston as a research assistant for a documentary, and for Batter's Box, a gameshow show that aired on NESN for which she was a production assistant with writing and researching responsibilities.  I have no doubt that she's going to be very successful once she has her degree and can start looking for full-time work.<br/><br/>The total cost of the semesters will be just shy of $20,000.  The remaining $5,000 of this loan will be invested in a new HD digital film camera that she can use for work (there is a lot of work in the Boston area that requires a person to have his/her own equipment, so we expect the investment to pay itself back in 3-6 months if she's working part-time while still in school).<br/><br/>My base verifiable salary for 2009 was $98,000.

Income stated is all me, I have other rental properties but no way to verify this (and the income) it brings (is there?).  Why I haven't taken a HELCO on the houses I own for repairs? I have the houses in controllership of an LLC (that my wife and I own).

I anticipate having no trouble repaying this loan. <br/><br/>Since this loan is actually being offered at a slightly lower rate than my student loans are currently, I would imagine that it would be in my interest to worry about paying down my student debt first.  That is, I do not intend to prepay this loan in the very near future. <br/><br/>Thank you all for your consideration.<br/>",other,Unexpected Expense Loan,112xx,NY,4.04,0,2,,,12,0,1621,5.3,14,f,872.06,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,61th week,0,,,,1

Because of this I want to gain control of my finances and eliminate the credit card debt I have accrued in a timely  manner. From my credit report, you will see that I have a track record of paying my credit on time with no late payments whatsoever. To date, I have paid off a mortgage, a car loan and a personal signature loan, as well as other miscellaneous credit lines. I returned to college to get a Master's degree in a highly-specialized field, and during this period, I was financially dependent to some extent on credit cards and student loans (I also won scholarships). Using as my credit as I have had over the last several years has lowered my credit score only because of the impact it has had on my income-to-debt-ratio, but it is not at all due to unreliable behavior. My wife is financially independent with less than $500 of debt and my parents are covering my student loan payments until I get my credit card debt resolved. Your only fear should be that I may be able to pay off this loan before you get to collect all of the interest you may want to receive on it. My job is very stable and it is funded by two of the largest grants (RO1's) endowed to professors at Harvard Medical for the next ten years (Children's Hospital Boston research facilities are all affiliated with Harvard Medical School). I will probably be completing a doctorate here as well with a stipend comparable to my current salary. I would surely appreciate your confidence in me as a borrower and I look forward to making definite progress on paying down my credit card debt. Thank you very much.<br/>  > I understand I may not seem like a great yielding investment in comparison to some with worse credit scores, but in my instance you are guaranteed at least your money back. My monthly expenses can be estimated at about $1100 per month. However, I earn more than twice as much as that  per month. I am as reliable as they get because of the expectation I have for my life in the next ten years. This includes owning a home with my wife and raising a family. To be functional in this day and age, one needs great credit. To remain functional, I am trying to become debt free as soon as I possibly can. Help me get this loan, and not only can you feel good about the investment intrinsically, but there is a rather secure extrinsic reward waiting at the other end of this as well.

Hereâs some more information to help you in your investment decision.  <br/><br/>Professionally, I'm a physician and have been in practice since October, 2007.  I work in a government run hospital in the Emergency Room where I have been for over 2 years.  I have a great job, and due to a recent promotion, Iâll be getting a raise soon.  <br/><br/>Personally, I am good with my money.  I live within my means and as a rule try to only borrow money for school, purchasing a new home, babies, and cars if needed.  Up until I started having children, I paid cash for my cars, but upgraded for the safety of my two young children and my wife.  We bought a home a year ago, at a good price and interest, and are current on all debt.  We owe less than market value on our home, and also we have homeowners and mortgage insurance.  The mortgage insurance is the good kind, not part of my loan, but an extra insurance that I got for security.  It would make my mortgage payment for up to a year if I were to lose my job or were unable to work.  <br/><br/>Normally, we use one credit card, which we pay off every month.  The debt we have now comes from back in residency to buy my car, which I am still driving, when we had our first child.  Other debt we incurred when we were saving to buy our current home, we used our credit cards for some purchases to increase our cash savings to buy down our loan interest rate.  And lastly, we also bought a minivan after having a second child.  (Used, low mileage, and a great price due to a few small dents).  I also have student loans and the mortgage mentioned above.  <br/><br/>Plan: We are working to be debt free.  I want to consolidate and pay off the debts mentioned above first, then pay off student loans and mortgage.  Although, I can do this with my current job alone, I am also starting a part-time second job at a private hospitalâs ER on April 16th to earn extra money to get out of debt sooner.  We do have cash in savings in reserve for emergencies.  We also have an IRA and a government retirement account.<br/><br/>I hope this extra information helps you in your decision.  I am open to answer questions if you have them.  Thanks for your interest and investment.<br/>  > I tried to answer a question from an investor and accidentally deleted it, so here's some more information based on the questions.<br/><br/>I am the sole wage earner. <br/>No Second Mortgage.  No HELOC.<br/>I'd be happy to have automatic deductions from my checking account.  <br/><br/>Although my Income from my first job is sufficient to pay all my obligations, including this loan, I am starting a second job mid April 2010.<br/><br/>My backup plan:  If I were to lose my income from my primary job, which would be unlikely as I am tenured, have already had my yearly review, and due for a bonus and $15,000/year raise due to a recent promotion (I didnât include this in my salary reported, since it isnât showing on my paycheck yet).  If the worst were to happen and I lost my primary job, I would accept full-time status on the second job, which would pay more than my primary job without the benefits.  I didnât include any income from this second job in my proposal, as I havenât started it yet.  Having a second job increases my discretionary income and gives me increased control of my income, savings and a backup plan.  I also have a savings account, a cash reserve and short and long-term disability insurance.  Lastly, my student loans are deferrable, so as part of my back up plan above, if I needed to, Iâd put them into deferment and pay off my short-term debts first.<br/><br/>I hope this clarifies.

During this program, I met my girlfriend with whom I sincerely want to spend the rest of my life.  Being early in my career, I make what I consider a very respectable salary.  However, given the nature of the career path that I am on, the amount of money that I have saved is not enough to buy a ring that would be respectable 10 years down the road.

I was left holding the financial bag.  My daughter has now struggled with depression and PTSD among other things that eventually led to her abusing drugs to cope with the pain.  I have exhausted the resources for treatment available to us and had to pay for all or part of of treatment she has received over the last couple of years which was an unforseen financial expense, divorce proceedings, and am trying to pay 6200.00 owed to the IRS for $ he removed from a 401K (without my knowledge prior to his incarceration).  I still have debt outstanding to four different medical groups in the amts of 345.00, 650.00, 175.00, and 565.00.  I have been able to eliminate extra expenses related to my daughter that have cost hundreds of dollars, and will continue to find additional ways to cut costs.  The tuition is for the other two children in Catholic school.  I realize this may seem unnecessary, but I have worked very hard to provide a stable, safe, and secure environment for two children who have experienced the unexpected loss of their father and the devastation their older sister's drug addiction has caused.  This is one security I cannot change.  Tuition payments obviously aren't paid in June and July.  Lastly, This year between Jan and May I have an additional 1368.00/mo with the GI Bill as a full-time student.  I will collect that same amount in the fall of 2010 between Sep-Dec. as well.  I haven't had an emergency fund and have been robbing Peter to pay Paul the last few months.  The purpose of the loan is to catch up on monthly expense bills (behind one month on all bills), pay off medical, pay down IRS and decrease Visa (17.4%) in an attempt to increase credit score.

Thank you for your consideration.<br/>  > I would like to clarify my comment about lowering my monthly payments by 50.00 by stating this would include payment to the Lending Club investors as well. One of the creditors that would be paid in full is Citi-Financial which I currently have a monthly payment of $176.00, others are Capital One, Chase and Juniper.  I have created a monthly budget offered through my bank. Also I do bill pay and have auto withdrawal set up on some accounts which are a tremendous aid in keeping current. My bills are paid before the due date every month and as you can see I have zero delinquencies. The only recent blemish is a $43.00 medical bill which has been paid for several months now but continues to show on my credit report.<br/>",debt_consolidation,debt consolidation,498xx,MI,20.38,0,6,38,116,13,1,17578,76.8,30,f,2414.8,0,10.36,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,83th week,0,,,,0

Thank you for taking the time to consider my loan!  <br/>I would like to use my loan for paying off my credit card debt.   I&rsquo;ve worked for the past 7 years designing software.  I work at large companies, not startups so there is no danger of being laid off.   While Oracle is very stable, I haven&rsquo;t had a raise or bonus in 3 years.  The only additional income I&rsquo;ve had is a thousand dollars from filing patents.<br/>I first got into debt in college, as most people do.  Unlike others at my Ivy League university, I paid for college myself.  I paid for everything, starting with my application fee while still in high school.  Whereas other parents paid their part in the financial aid package, my mother loaned me the money for theirs @ 7%.  (Of course she was the first to be paid back&hellip; who wants to have an angry mother!)  I also worked full time for the first two years.  In hindsight, this was not the best decision, but I wanted a quality education and had to pay for it somehow.  Fast forward 4 years.  I graduated with around $50K in loans and $30K in credit card debt.<br/>Over the years my credit card balances have had their ups and downs.  The most recent upswing started 4 years ago when I bought my house.  It is 110 years old, so as you can imagine, there is a lot to do!  I&rsquo;ve done all the small things I can without hiring professionals, but I know that is the next step.  Before I start any remodeling I know I need to pay off my credit card debt and save up.  <br/>If you check, my credit score is good.  Partially because I&rsquo;m great at paying on time, partially because I&rsquo;m one out of five people on a $1.1M home loan.  The building is a 4 plex.  My portion of the loan is $400K.  I bought my house just before the market bottomed out.  Not the best time, but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of my house as an investment to flip.  <br/>All of this combined was not a prescription for financial health.  Add to it the financial meltdown(s) over the last few years and it just compounded the issues.  During the boom years, credit card companies gave me more and more credit.  Then after the meltdown they all started to re-assess their credit strategies.  They looked at me and decided I was carrying too much debt and they needed to lower my credit limits &ndash; to just above my balance.  This meant that my credit to debt ratio went from great to high risk almost overnight.  And where one credit card company goes, others are sure to follow &ndash; and they did.  Eventually, this affected my credit score and brought it from Excellent to Good.  That was the end of Round 1.  In Round 2 they looked at my credit score and then my APRs.  Several cards were raised astronomically, which was the final blow.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Axing the APR,941xx,CA,16.8,0,0,,,9,0,49692,89.3,22,f,3503.98,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,148th week,0,,,,1

That was alot of info i had down about me, maybe to much.  Anyway...  <br/>   Short Version.= I am 31  and i recently became a first time buyer home owner this year.  I had some good luck, I been saving 3 years ago more than half my monthly paycheck been going to my saving account., also about year and half ago i decided to start fixing my credit, it was 561 and to this day it is at a 741.  I have to admit it was perfect timing when I picked out this brand new 3b/2b 2200 sq ft house for 120k. I been planning this out for such a long time.  I gave alot of dedication, money, and work into buying a house, and it payed off. Plus made it in time for the first time buyer tax credit.   I researched what i needed to put down: 20% and found out the closing cost was around 5k.  I been working since the middle of 2003 at our family exporting business to Latin America, With the recession happening our business kept running strong, we all notice some change but kept on moving.  Our company exports fertilizer, insecticides, and pesticides  that are biodegradable and environmentally .safe  for the farms down there.  It is a very good and stable job, people need to eat.  I been living in my new house for about 5-6 months.  I figured that the left over money i had left the buying the house would be enough to get some appliances and improve and upgrade the house.  Well i know now some appliances are up there in price and it isn't the fancy pieces. also started with hardwood flooring in areas and found out the hard way that the money went fast and most of it was for the little things u do not calculate. Everything is perfect with bills and credit cards, since they have low credit.  For some of the projects ( finishing the floors, counter top for the kitcken and fixtures cost some money.  It is very easy for me to make payments, i keep at least 3 weeks -month ahead of all my bills, the 20% down gave me a really good monthly payment rate.  With my great credit score i been pre approve for the credit cards that can help, but after picking 2 and being denied after pre approve it was more hurting me with inquires.  I find it difficult to come up with 2-3k or the full price to have it at that time for somewhat big purchase for the house, np with coming up with 1-1.5k  for a down payment and go with payment but even if i had the money to back it up like always having low credit limit and now Inquiry are adding up are preventing my chance. even with a killer credit score with a mortgage. When i looked at this site going through my credit score online seeing that the payments at 300 is perfect fit in my cycle of bills for each month.  I hope luck is on my side with this just like the house because this pretty much my last hope to get the ball moving.  I have been perfect the last 5 years no late payment nothing to get to were i am at.  I take my credit and monthly payments very seriously.  This loan can finish my sections of wood flooring. grabbing the rest of the pieces to my bed room set, kitchen counter top.  upgrading the fixtures and adding some furinture to the other bedrooms.  It is this loan which i used up a credit inquiry, or ill have to wait for how long when they want raise my credit which some already which i am happy but still low.   I apologize to anyone that has read this far.

I had two credit cards with high credit line amounts cut down to just above the current amount owed (such as $21,000 to 10,900 and it drops every time I pay another 500 off). This ratio of total credit line to amount owed was always an emergency buffer in case of unforeseen expenses. This also affected my credit rating (was 730 a year ago) by lowering the owed to available ratio). I have a few expenses such as car repairs and a small garage roof leak which I'm putting off due to not enough credit card balance. I also have a few doctor bills (after the insurance paid their portion) for when my wife had a hospital visit due to a heart issue. I would use the money to pay these several small amounts and also pay off a few small amounts on store/gas/Dell credit accounts. The remainder would be kept in the bank as reserve so I wouldn't need to use a credit card and I can concentrate on paying them down to improve my credit rating.

I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited. In other words, I am very employable, even without my own private practice.<br/>",debt_consolidation,DebtCon,980xx,WA,9.84,1,0,11,,9,0,35061,94.2,30,f,1286.33,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,157th week,0,,,,1

And what makes me a good candidate for repaying this loan off is that I am in the medical field which is in high demand so I do not see myself losing my job, I am in a very well stable field. As we all know there is a high demand in the medical field right, which is where I am right now. I pay my credit cards on time.

This can be found at TCABC.com under the teachings page if interested. The teaching on money margin really hit home, as my wife and I have made more money we have spent more money, like most Americans. We have gotten involved with Financial Peace University and started using Mint.com to help us achieve our goal of getting out of debt in 3 to 4 years. We have both been blessed to work for almost 10 years with companies that have shown steady growth even over the last 2 years instead of suffering from the economic downturn. I manage the recruiting for a division of one of the premier convenience store chains that has more new stores in development than it has in 20 years. We are doing very well.

I will definitely answer your questions by the end of the workday.<br/><br/>I will be opening my motorcycle repair shop in the SOMA district in San Francisco, sometime in March 2011.  This will be my model shop, since I plan to expand to the rest of the Bay Area. I have about a fourth of the equipment for the shop, i.e., tire machine, hydraulic lift, and misc tools. I have very low overhead, since I will not be buying motorcycle apparel inventory.  Sometime in the future, I will be selling motorcycle apparel from a Japanese leather company that would like to start selling in the Bay Area, again.  I have a direct contact with one of the owners and I am brokering a deal that the shop will not incur upfront cost for the first six months.<br/><br/>I will be buying used motorcycles to recondition and sell. I already have two in my garage to sell. I plan to be an authorized repair facility with major insurance carriers, i.e., AAA, State Farm, Progressive, Geico Insurance, etc.  Motorcycle insurance jobs are usually several thousand dollars to repair on average and the shop will actively seek this type of repair jobs.<br/><br/>The business will be modeled similarly to a salon-type structure, whereas the mechanic will rent out a service station and will be able to use the shop equipment for a fee. The fee for renting out the service bay will be $1500.00 a month. All service technicians working for the shop will be able to handle any job, from a simple oil change to complete engine tear-down and rebuild. They will be paid a commission split of 60/40 (60% to the shop, 40% to mechanic). The shop labor rate will be between $88-$110 per hour, depending on the mechanic&rsquo;s level of experience. <br/><br/>With over 45 years of combined motorcycle service experience. I already have three journeyman mechanics onboard for my shop and they will be able to diagnosis and repair customer&rsquo;s vehicles quickly and correctly, the first time. By hiring journeyman mechanics, this will limit the number of incorrect diagnosis that plague shops that hire cheap, inexperienced mechanics with no former shop experience or that are fresh out of tech schools. After all, repeat business is how businesses survive the long haul.  I want to build an excellent reputation for the motorcycling community. <br/><br/>There are a lot of other great details, but I can only give a short description for now. Please contact me with any questions you may have.  Thank you ahead of time for your time and consideration.<br/>  > One more day left.

Then I would like to slowly start looking for homes.<br/>  > I have been working with my company for a few years now. The company is doing well now and the stocks are slowly trending upwards. I try to be a wise investor myself. So, here is the details of how I plan to use my funds so you can chose wisely as well:<br/>I tried negotiating lower rates with all the banks but they denied it because of high revolving balance. I was never late on payments or skipped out on payments. I hate the amount of interest I am paying, so I need this loan to consolidate the debt and lower the interest rates. This loan will help me build my savings while making sure the debt is paid off in a couple years.<br/>Toyota Loan - $9,297.00@2.90% -- At $592.86/month which is my actual payment, it will be paid off in 15 months. I will not consolidate this, as this loan has a lower rate than this loan and is not a revolving account.<br/>HSBC $6,808.00 @19.99% - Will consolidate this. This account was previously owned by Suzuki. But when HSBC bought it they hiked the rates. I closed this account.<br/>Chase $5,059.60@17.99% - Will consolidate this. This was previously owned by Circuit City and had low interest deals. But Chase bought it and boosted the rates. I will keep this account open to keep my revolving balance low. But, I do not plan to run it up anymore. I will use cash for future purchases.<br/>E-Trade $9,126.00@19.99% - I will keep this open but pay it off partially with ESPP in Feb of next year and renegotiate a lower rate when my revolving balance is lower.<br/><br/>I am not interested in buying a home for a couple of years. I am planning on saving until I have 20% down payment, because I do not want to make PMI payments.<br/>Regardless, I am looking right now at the housing market and trends. Even though I have cash to cover all my debts, I was saving it in case a beautiful house came up on the market that is within my budget and is close enough to work.<br/>",debt_consolidation,On the way to buy a home,951xx,CA,13.48,0,0,,,6,0,14944,84.6,16,f,1397.58,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,100th week,0,,,,1

Total of all debt to be paid off is $33,900.00 at payments at $1,188.00.<br/>Payment on the new loan should be $880.00 which shows a monthly debt savings of $308.00 per month, I should be able to apply this savings towards the new loan to shorten the term from 5 years to somewhere around 3.5 to 4 years.<br/>  <br/>What makes me a good borrower? I make a decent income of about $115,000.00 per year selling new homes for a large builder in a market that&rsquo;s been down but is now on its way back.

I have never been late making payments on any of my debts and intend to keep it that way.<br/><br/>With this new loan my budget is simple, my mortgage payment is $1,780.00 and the new loan of $880.00 totals $2,660.00. My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments. The main goal for this loan is to get out from under the credit card lenders and their high rates as well as getting the debts from my ex wife paid off.<br/>  <br/>Regarding my job stability, last year was one of my highest income years since I have been in the new home building market, 9 years total and each year is better for me.

He was able to get scholarships and grants for the first 3 years of college, but I am paying the loan on his senior year and 1/2 his rent/room/board.  My middle daughter has also been relying on my help.  Her husband has abandoned her and their 3-year old daughter.  She is working full time, but cannot afford her apartment but also was not allowed out of her lease.  She will be moving back home, but I have had to help with her rent fairly frequently over the past 6 months.  No surprise, my income simply cannot cover all that plus my normal household bills.  My husband was laid off last January (2010)- he has been mostly steadily working temp. jobs and making enough to cover the mortgage on our house, plus groceries.  I am making up payments for everything else.  No surprise, during the lean periods I have had to use the credit card and line-of-credit to pay normal expenses.  I want this loan to pay off my line-of-credit, one small personal loan, and both credit cards.  And, no, I can't increase my work hours...on my days off, I watch my granddaughter- daycare is so expensive, my daughter would be forced deeper into debt paying for it.<br/>Thank you all for your questions- I really appreciate you all so much.  I am so amazed that I have already received so much finding even without any explanation from me what it is for/why do I need it.  Thank you all again!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Putting it all together,221xx,VA,23.86,0,2,32,,15,0,18285,52.8,46,f,6869.75,0,0,0,0,,INDIVIDUAL,,187th week,0,,,,1

Their business has slowed considerably the past couple of years. It's not uncommon to have several months where we operate at a net loss. My father is 63 and his health is debilitating, so he cannot even consider a career change. They are struggling desperately for money, and have run out of alternatives as their bills pile up.<br/><br/>I would be a good borrower for this loan because I have perfect credit - no late payments and everything is paid on time. In human relations, I value integrity and credibility above all else. If I owe someone, I do everything in my power to make sure it's paid back. Honor is important.<br/><br/>My monthly take-home is about $3,000. Car payment is $213.88, student loans total $147.15. Monthly expenses total about $600. I don't spend very much money and am definitely capable of making the monthly payments on this loan. If there is any doubt, my sister just finished her third year of medical school so there may be a spike in household income within the next two years.<br/><br/>I have a very stable job as Assistant Vice President of Marketing and play an integral role in my company's business operations. I report directly to the President, and she trusts me with many important decisions that affect the company's bottom line. All things held constant, I will be with them for a very long time.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my loan listing. Please contribute! Anything you lend would be helping a family in need.

I plan to pay off this loan possibly before the end of the term, but in case I use the full loan term, at least I will have paid less in interest vs. my current credit card rates. I have a stable job in a very stable company, in a very stable field. I pride myself of being a responsible individual, with a very stable life, and I wouldnt do anything to jeopardize that. I truly believe I am a good borrower not only because of my history, but because my cash flow would benefit when using the loan to pay my credit cards balance.  I realize investing in someone you don't know is a big risk, but hopefully my credit history will substantiate my worthiness. All I want to do is pay off some high interest credit card debt that I incurred-in for reasons beyond my control.

The income listed in not household but individual. This credit card has been paid off slowly from 22k to 7780 in a year and a half. The problem is everytime I make a huge payment, the credit card company lowers the credit limit to whatever I paid. For instance I made a 10k payment. Then they lowered the limit 10k. This affects my credit score and debt to ratio. I have never been late on a payment.  The credit card company claims that they have been affected by the economy and those whom filed chapter 13/7. So they are lowering credit limits to off set their loss. It's upsetting. I worked hard to have my credit score be in the excellent range, I never asked for a credit increase. They increased it, and when I used it with the intention to pay off in 2 years. They are now lowering it as I pay off, which affects me. I will cancel this card if my loan is funded. I have had that account for almost 13 years and this is the thanks I get from them.
